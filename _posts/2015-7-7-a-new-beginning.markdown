<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> am starting all over - again. Maybe this will take some more time to die than my other projects. We'll find out together.</p>

Since I started discovering the computer, I always tried to create something meaningful. Something other people might have interest in, something to share. So far, I started to other projects, a [travelblog][japanruft] and a [podcast][edl] (in german), both of which died after some time. Both times they died, after I discovered that creating something takes a lot of effort, work and **TIME**. But maybe this blog will be different.

"Why", you might ask? Because I just needed a place to take some notes somewhere. And in contrast to the other to projects, I won't have to deliver content in a constant frequency, which I found to be the most negative part in creating something. It makes something to seem more like **work** and less fun. 

So to finish my introductory words, I shall finish my lame excuses for pure lazyness with a short description, what you probably will find in this blog in the future: Currently I have the great possibility to toy around with some new big data related technology - namely apache hadoop - and thought, that my therefound discoveries might be worth to write down and sharing.

So look out for more posts about log processing using the hadoop eco-system, cluster computing, kaggle-challenges/data science and some smaller personal projects like toying around with my raspberry pi. 

Read you in the future, Simon
